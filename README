JXCSS is a SAX-generating CSS2 parser adapter written in Java.

JXCSS can be fed from any SAC-compliant CSS2 parser. As the parser processes a stylesheet,
JXCSS produces a stream of SAX events that model the stylesheet's deep structure. JXCSS
can be connected to any SAX content handler, such as an XSLT or STX transformation.

The generated XML conforms with JXCSS's own DTD (XCSS), which models stylesheets in
accordance to the W3C Level-2 DOM. An alternative, compact syntax is also available.

JXCSS can be used to easily instrument or refactor existing CSS stylesheets as well as to
dynamically generate new ones.

JXCSS has been tested with the SteadyState, Flute and Batik SAC CSS2 parsers.
